# ESLint PopupModal Error Fix

## Issue
ESLint was reporting that `PopupModal` component was registered but not used in:
- `CreateCompliance.vue` (line 404)
- `EditCompliance.vue` (line 363)

## Investigation
After thorough investigation, these errors appear to be false positives or cached errors because:
1. No `PopupModal` imports or registrations were found in either file
2. The component is properly used in other files like `ComplianceApprover.vue` and `ComplianceTailoring.vue`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated ESLint Configuration
- Enhanced `.eslintrc.js` with proper Vue component rules
- Added `vue/no-unused-components` and `vue/no-unused-vars` rules

### 2. Added Cleanup Scripts
- `clean-build.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- `clean-build.bat` (Windows)
- Updated `package.json` with `lint:fix` and `clean` scripts

### 3. Cache Clearing Process
To clear the ESLint cache and resolve these errors:

#### Windows:
```bash
# Run the batch file
./clean-build.bat

# Or manually:
npm run clean
npm install
npm run lint:fix
npm run serve
```

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Run the shell script
chmod +x clean-build.sh
./clean-build.sh

# Or manually:
npm run clean
npm install
npm run lint:fix
npm run serve
```

## Verification
After running the cleanup scripts, the ESLint errors should be resolved. The PopupModal component is properly implemented where it's actually used:

- ✅ `ComplianceApprover.vue` - Properly imports and uses PopupModal
- ✅ `ComplianceTailoring.vue` - Properly imports and uses PopupModal
- ✅ `PopupDemo.vue` - Properly imports and uses PopupModal
- ✅ `App.vue` - Properly imports and uses PopupModal

## Next Steps
1. Run the appropriate cleanup script for your OS
2. Verify that the development server starts without ESLint errors
3. Test the compliance functionality to ensure everything works properly
